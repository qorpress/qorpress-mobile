# Contributing to the Project

## Workflow

- Fork the project.
- Make your bug fix or feature addition.
- Add tests for it. This is important so we don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
- Send a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.

Please make sure that you have [set up your user name and email address](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) for use with Git.

Pull requests for bug fixes must be based on the current stable branch.

We are trying to keep backwards compatibility breaks in to an absolute minimum. Please take this into account when proposing changes.

Due to time constraints, we are not always able to respond as quickly as we would like. Please do not take delays personal and feel free to remind us if you feel that we forgot to respond.
